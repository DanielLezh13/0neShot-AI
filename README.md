# OneShotAI (Archived Prototype)

Archived prototype — first attempt at building an AI interface before DartBoard.
Stateless AI, single-shot compression model, basic frontend + backend stack.

Status: Archived — Early Prototyping Phase (Built ~6 months before DartBoard)

---

## Overview

OneShotAI was my first attempt at building an AI interaction layer.

The goal was simple:
- Build a minimal full-stack app  
- Test OpenAI API integration  
- Experiment with stateless, compressed LLM responses  
- Create a primitive UI for “one question → one answer” interaction  

What started here eventually evolved into the ideas behind DartBoard, my modern AI system.

## Features

- Basic user → assistant chat flow  
- Stateless “single-shot” LLM prompting  
- Early exploration of compressed, non-conversational AI responses  
- Simple backend routing  
- Very early UI experiments (before I knew React/Next.js)

## Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Python  
- FastAPI  
- OpenAI API

**Frontend**
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (very early, minimal)

## Why This Repo Exists

This project represents:
- My earliest experiments with LLM apps  
- My first time hooking a backend + frontend together  
- The conceptual seed for DartBoard's mode system  
- A reference point for my portfolio showing how far I’ve come  

This repo is intentionally archived as a milestone, not as an active project.

## Current Status

❗ Archived — no longer maintained  
✔ Kept for historical + portfolio purposes  
✔ Useful when showing progression from prototype → full product (DartBoard)
